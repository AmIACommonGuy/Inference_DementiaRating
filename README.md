# Inference_DementiaRating
Dementia is characterized as the loss of cognitive function, and is strongly associated with the elderly in popular understandings. It frequently interferes with a person's ability to reason, remember and function on a daily basis. As the baby boom generation ages, and as a reduction in sudden mortality, or preventable causes younger in life changes the demographics of the world population, understanding the social and medical factors that play a role in the severity of dementia will be important.
In this project, we take on a statistical view to study the association among demantia and multiple social economical factors.

The detailed statistical report is listed as Final_report_DemRating.
